## What is ImageXcelerate?
ImageXcelerate is a specialized platform designed for the purpose of comparing and enhancing the quality of images, particularly X-ray images. The methods employed to improve the images encompass the fuzzy Mamdani, fuzzy Sugeno, and fuzzy Tsukamoto approaches.

The website is a development of a previous project created for the final exam of an artificial intelligence course. One of the main advantages of ImageXcelerate is that the enhanced images are not stored on the server, ensuring user data privacy and security. This is due to the fact that the website is not connected to a database, thus there is no permanent storage of uploaded images or the results of the enhancement process.

### ImageXcelerate Services
